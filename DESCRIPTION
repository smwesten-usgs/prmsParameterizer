Description:
    This is a collection of functions and scripts that demonstrate how the R scripting language
    may be used along with gridded datasets to generate a set of distrubuted parameters for the
    USGS PRMS model. One clear benefit of using a scripting language to generate PRMS parameters is
    that the process is somewhat self-documenting; in other words, rather than a collection of unrecorded
    calculations in the PRMS GUI, the script requires one to write out an explicit set of rules to be used
    in the parameter generation.
